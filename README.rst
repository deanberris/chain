This implementation is a proof-of-concept for an immutable string using only
standard C++11 features that follows the lead on how rope is implemented.

More details to follow as the implementation is fleshed out more.

Requires a fully compliant C++11 compiler and standard library. Recommendation
is to use GCC 4.6 and libc++.
